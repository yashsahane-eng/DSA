# DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

A collection of **daily problem-solving solutions** focused on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **C++ and Python**.

This repo tracks my progress solving real algorithmic problems, mostly from platforms like **LeetCode**, and serves both as a **personal practice log** and a **resource for others learning DSA**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🔍 About the Project

Solving algorithmic problems consistently is the only real way to get comfortable with DSA concepts and prepare for technical interviews.

This repository contains:

- Problem solutions in **C++ and Python**
- Well-structured code with clarity and optimized approaches
- Problems covering arrays, linked lists, strings, trees, sorting, dynamic programming, and more :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🧠 Tech & Languages

| Language | Use |
|----------|------|
| **C++** | Main language for most solutions |
| **Python** | Used for select problems |
| *(Extension)* | LeetPush extension manages updates automatically :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashsahane-eng/DSA.git
Navigate into the folder:

cd DSA
Open any solution you want to study:

.cpp files for C++

.py files for Python

Compile & run with your tools of choice:

C++ (g++):

g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
Python:

python filename.py
🧩 Covered Topics (Representative)
✔ Arrays
✔ Strings
✔ Linked Lists
✔ Trees
✔ Sorting & Searching
✔ Dynamic Programming
✔ Hashing
✔ Unique Paths & Combinatorics
✔ Many classic interview questions 

For a full list, scroll through the files — each file name reflects the problem solved. 

📈 Why This Matters
Consistent practice on algorithmic problems:

Improves problem-solving instincts

Deepens understanding of time/space complexity

Prepares you for coding interviews

Builds a reference archive you can revisit

This repo is meant to be lived with, expanded, and revisited. 

📄 Contribution
This repo is primarily your own practice log — contributions from others are welcome if they:

Add new solved problems

Improve existing solutions

Add meaningful explanations or complexity analysis

Fork → branch → PR → review → merge.
